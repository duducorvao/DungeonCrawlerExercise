# DungeonCrawlerExercise

Create a “dungeon crawler simulator” that runs on the console.

The game must run on the console, and simulate battles between the player and a series of enemies. The application must start by asking the user to choose a name for their character. Next, you must ask the user to choose the number of enemies they want to face. Each enemy needs to have its stats randomly assigned within a reasonable range. The app must create a dynamic array with all these enemies, and iterate over it, simulating combat between the player and the enemy, until one of them dies. When the player dies or the enemy list runs out, the game should end, and inform the following:

* If the player won or died
* How many enemies of each size did the player kill, and how many did they miss?

Example:
> You lose!\
> Enemies Slain:\
> Big:     3/7\
> Medium:  7/14\
> Small:   13/20
